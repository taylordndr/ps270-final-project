## Introduction 

### Research Question 
How has county type, in conjunction with gender and racial composition, impacted prison incarceration rates across American counties from 2006 to 2016?

### Hypothesis 
I hypothesize that the more urban an American county, the higher the prison incarceration rate for Americans living in that county will be; as urban nature increases, prison incarceration rates will increase. Based on prior knowledge, I expect that this trend of higher prison incarceration rate for more urban counties will exist across all genders and races. However, I predict a disproportionately higher rate of prison incarceration for men over women, as well as for Black, Latinx and Native American individuals over White and AAPI Americans as the urban nature of American counties increases. Over a 10-year time frame From 2006 to 2016, I predict incarceration rates for all the aforementioned groups to have decreased over time. 

### Importance 
Over the course of American criminal history, Criminal Justice policies have changed drastically and prison incarceration, particularly in the late 20th and early 21st century, saw immense acceleration. However, the most current prison systems are supposedly seeing a decline in incarceration. The following study will work to analyze the "who", "when", and "where", as well as a potential "why" of these modern (2006 to 2016) American incarceration trends. 

Analyzing the extent to which living in an American urban center, across gender and racial lines, enhances the prison incarceration rates in that particular place will face these questions. Much research in the fields of Criminal Justice and Sociology found in the late 1900s and early 2000s patterns of increased incarceration for American cities, American ethnic centers, as opposed to in more suburban or rural areas of the country. And though more modern 21st century prisons are seeing changes in incarceration rates, disproportionate incarceration for particular places and particular groups of people has remained consistent.

Research on "who" is being incarcerated and "where", as well as "why" they are being incarcerated is an important first step in understanding how American society can work to both continue lessening rates of incarceration and improving the effectiveness of punishment. Incarcerated Americans lose access to civil responsibilities, become estranged from their families and society more broadly, endure mental and physical illness, and often end up back in prison after release. Though incarceration attempts to hinder crime, Americans, especially those of male and minority communities, are being incarcerated consistently and disproportionately. Therefore, some part of the system is broken. However, if researchers can come to understand "who" is being incarcerated and "where" they are coming from, we can begin to comprehend the "why" of prison incarceration, which begins the most pivotal work on "how" we are going to further fix it moving into the future. 

## The Data 

### Description of the Data Source 
This study will use the Incarceration Trends Dataset (2020) from the Vera Institute of Justice as the data source. This source draws together a multitude of census surveys that analyze incarceration trends in the American prison system between 1970 and 2016. The aforementioned dataset is sourced from: the National Corrections Reporting Program (NCRP), the Deaths in Custody Reporting Program (DCRP), the Annual Survey of Jails (ASJ), the Census of Jails (COJ), the Census of State and Federal Adult Correctional Facilities (CAF), the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting Program (UCR), the Centers on Disease Control (CDC) (the National Vital Statistics System Data), the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the U.S. Census Bureau. The dataset contains information by American county on several variables, including: county populations, county types, prison populations, as well as general census and prison census data on both gender and racial identity. 

#### Measuring the Independent & Dependent Variables 
As mentioned, the independent and dependent variables in the following study are sourced from census prison records and general population census data collection. The main independent variable of interest in this study is county type, referred to as `urbanicity` in the code. County type is rated on a scale of Rural, Small/Midsize, Suburban, or Urban. The co-independent variables of interest will be Gender (`Male` or `Female`) and Race (`AAPI`, `Black`, `Latinx`, `Native` (Native American), or `White`), which are rates at which that population is incarcerated per their population (ages 15-64) in their respective county. 

*Note: No or minimal data was available for Non-Binary or Other Gender categories as well as for Other Race categories within the Incarceration Trends Dataset; so these groups were not included in this study.*

The dependent variable is the incarceration rate (`prison_prop` or `urban_proportion` in the code), which is calculated as the proportion of incarcerated individuals from an American county per un-incarcerated individuals (between ages 15 to 64) living in that same county. The age group of 15 to 64 was chosen to depict the proportion of incarceration across the most common, most likely eligible prison-age population.

It is also important to note that the representations in the following study will either be presented as being data from either 2006 or 2016, a 10-year time frame of modern American prisons, presented together for comparison purposes.

#### The Research Design
This study will be using a cross-sectional research design, collecting and analyzing data from a particular period in time to understand a trend in the real world (incarceration rate trends). I will be comparing two of these cross-sectional analyses, one from 2006 and another from 2016, to see how consistent the found trends are over a 10-year time frame.

#### Interpretations of Data Visualizations Pt.1
In 2006, male prison incarceration rates are significantly higher than female incarceration rates in all county types. For men, Urban counties saw the highest incarceration rates (1.62%), then Rural counties (1.41%), Small/Midsize counties (1.28%), then with Suburban counties seeing the lowest rates (1.05%). For women, Rural counties saw the highest incarceration rates (0.15%), then Small/Midsize counties (0.12%), Urban counties (0.11%), then with Suburban counties seeing the lowest rates (0.10%).

In 2016, male prison incarceration rates are also significantly higher than female incarceration rates in all county types. For men, Rural counties saw the highest incarceration rates (1.42%), then Urban counties (1.27%), Small/Midsize counties (1.26%), then with Suburban counties seeing the lowest rates (1.00%). For women, Rural counties saw the highest incarceration rates (0.18%), then Small/Midsize counties (0.13%), Suburban counties (0.12%), then with Urban counties seeing the lowest rates (0.07%).

Overall, over time and county type, male incarceration rates are consistently significantly higher than female incarceration rates. In both 2006 to 2016, male incarceration rates were consistently higher in Rural and Urban counties over Small/Midsize and Suburban counties. Suburban counties consistently saw the lowest rates of incarceration for men. Female incarceration did not follow the same pattern; female incarceration rates, generally, declined as the county type became more urban. Rural counties consistently saw the highest rates of incarceration for women. Additionally, incarceration rate levels for men generally decreased from 2006 to 2016 and increased for women.

#### Interpretations of Data Visualizations Pt.2
In 2006, AAPI incarceration rates were highest in Rural counties (0.37%), then Small/Midsize counties (0.16%), Suburban counties (0.10%), with Urban counties seeing the lowest rates (0.09%). Black incarceration rates were highest in Small/Midsize counties (3.37%), then Urban counties (2.75%), Suburban counties (2.28%), with Rural counties seeing the lowest rates (0.55%). Latinx incarceration rates were highest in Small/Midsize counties (0.81%), then Urban counties (0.72%), Suburban counties (0.51%), with Rural counties seeing the lowest rates (0.32%). Native American incarceration rates were highest in Small/Midsize counties (1.24%), then Suburban counties (1.02%), Rural counties (0.90%), with Urban counties seeing the lowest rates (0.88%). White incarceration rates were highest in Small/Midsize counties (0.55%), then Urban counties (0.36%), Suburban counties (0.33%), with Rural counties seeing the lowest rates (0.25%).

In 2016, AAPI incarceration rates were highest in Rural counties (1.22%), then Small/Midsize counties (0.15%), Urban counties (0.08%), with Suburban counties seeing the lowest rates (0.07%). Black incarceration rates were highest in Rural counties (3.25%), then Small/Midsize counties (2.34%), Urban counties (2.00%), with Suburban counties seeing the lowest rates (1.56%). Latinx incarceration rates were highest in Rural counties (0.86%), then Small/Midsize counties (0.72%), Urban counties (0.55%), with Suburban counties seeing the lowest rates (0.42%). Native American incarceration rates were highest in Rural counties (3.74%), then Small/Midsize counties (1.47%), Suburban counties (0.91%), with Urban counties seeing the lowest rates (0.75%). White incarceration rates were highest in Rural counties (0.48%), then Small/Midsize counties (0.43%), Urban counties (0.30%), with Suburban counties seeing the lowest rates (0.27%).

For the AAPI community, in both 2006 and 2016, incarceration rates were higher in Rural and Small/Midsize counties than in Suburban or Urban counties. This group also almost always had the lowest incarceration rates than any other group. For Black Americans, in both 2006 and 2016, their incarceration rates were always higher than every other group in Small/Midsize, Suburban and Urban counties. Similarly to the AAPI community, incarceration rates for Black Americans were usually higher in Rural and Small/Midsize counties than in Suburban or Urban counties. For the Latinx community, Small/Midsize counties always saw higher incarceration rates than did Urban and Suburban counties. For Native Americans, Rural or Small/Midsize counties always saw the highest rates of incarceration and Urban counties saw the lowest rates of incarceration. For White Americans, Suburban and Urban counties saw lower rates of incarceration than Small/Midsize communities in both 2006 and 2016. Generally, most race groups saw similar incarceration rate levels between 2006 and 2016, with Native Americans seeing a drastic increase in 2016. In most cases, Rural or Small/Midsize counties trended to have higher incarceration rates for each racial group than Urban or Suburban counties. 

*Note: there is a noticeable inconsistency with the race data being fed to the `Black`, `Latinx` and `Native` (Native American) variables in 2006; the Incarceration Trends Dataset (2020) does not have plentiful data collection for these groups living in Rural counties every year, so the proportions are thrown off for 2006. This was a data collection issue within this study, as it is challenging to receive reliable data from certain communities, especially when it comes to reporting on racial incarceration data.*

#### Interpretations of Regression Models
In the above linear regression model, the Rural (intercept (Baseline)) coefficient is 0.797, the Small/Midsize coefficient is -0.128, the Suburban coefficient is -0.366, and the Urban coefficient is -0.119. Only the Rural and Suburban counties are statistically significant at the $\alpha = 0.05$ test level (both having p-values of 0 and therefore rejecting the null of no effect of county type on prison incarceration rates). Therefore, there is a statistically significant relationship that being a Rural county increases the incarceration rate of that county by 0.797 percentage points. There also is a statistically significant relationship that being a Suburban county decreases the incarceration rate of that county by -0.366 percentage points.

In the second multiple regression model, holding years (`year_2006` and `year_2007`), gender incarceration rates (`Male` and `Female`) and race incarceration rates (`AAPI`, `Black`, `Latinx`, `Native` (Native American) and `White`) constant at a fixed level, Rural county type and Suburban county type have the respective coefficients of 0.011 and -0.008. Both of these coefficients are statistically significant since both the p-values (Rural p-value = 0.004, Suburban p-value = 0.029) reject the null at the $\alpha = 0.05$ test level. Though the values shifted between the models (which makes sense when adding additional control variables with the multiple regression model), the relationships held consistent, meaning there is something specific, significant about Rural and Suburban communities that is contributing to their incarceration rates. 

## Conclusion 

Overall, I did not find support for my original hypothesis that the more urban a county, the higher the incarceration rate and this trend would carry for all gender and race categories. Based on the graphs, my main findings were as follows: over time and county type, male incarceration rates are consistently significantly higher than female incarceration rates, men see higher incarceration rates in Rural and Urban counties, female incarceration rates typically decline as the county type became more urban, the AAPI community always had the lowest incarceration rates versus other racial groupings, Black Americans saw the highest incarceration rates across all Small/Midsize, Suburban and Urban county types versus other racial groupings, and across races, Rural or Small/Midsize counties trended to have higher incarceration rates in each racial group than Urban or Suburban county types. 

Based on these graph interpretations, in addition to my findings with the regression models, there are two statistically significant relationships found in this study that I would say have causal effect: living in a Rural county has a positive impact on incarceration rates and being from a Suburban county has a negative impact on incarceration rates. 

Despite these findings, there are two main limitations in this study; one based off missing data and another of other potential confounding variables. As for missing data, there was minimal or no data on other gender identities, other racial groups and the data in some county types, particularly Rural counties, was limited. Having too small a data pool can conflate and undermine certain data predictions, as can be seen with the inconsistency of racial incarceration rates between 2006 and 2016. As for other confounding variables, it is likely financial status, political leaning and education level could be impacting incarceration rates, as these factors typically lead to different lifestyles in both Rural and Suburban communities. 

With more time and money, I could improve these analyses mainly through collecting more data. Collecting data on the aforementioned confounding variables: financial status, political leaning and education would lead more conclusively to what about Rural communities contributes to higher incarceration rates and what about Suburban communities leads to lower incarceration rates. Further analyses could also consider these factors across particularly male, Black and Native American communities, to understand their disproportionate levels of prison incarceration. Conducting these additional analyses could aid in forming policy: monetary and welfare policy, educational programming and education funding. Policies which could work to solve the American incarceration crisis at the roots.
