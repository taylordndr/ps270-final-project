## Introduction 

### Research Question 
How has county type, in conjunction with gender and racial composition, impacted prison incarceration rates across American counties from 2006 to 2016?

### Hypothesis 
I hypothesize that the more urban an American county, the higher the prison incarceration rate for Americans living in that county will be; as urban nature increases, prison incarceration rates will increase. And I expect that this trend of higher prison incarceration rate for more urban counties will exist across all genders and races. However, I predict a disproportionately higher rate of prison incarceration for men over women, as well as for Black, Latinx and Native American individuals over White and Asian Americans as the urban nature of American counties increases. Over a 10-year time frame From 2006 to 2016, I predict incarceration rates for all the aforementioned groups to have decreased over time. 

### Importance 
Over the course of American criminal history, Criminal Justice policies have changed drastically and prison incarceration, particularly in the late 20th and early 21st century, saw immense acceleration. However, the most current prison systems are supposedly seeing a decline in incarceration. The following study will work to analyze the "who", "when", and "where", as well as a potential "why" of these modern (2006 to 2016) American incarceration trends. 

Analyzing the extent to which living in an American urban center, across gender and racial lines, enhances the prison incarceration rates in that particular place will face these questions. Much research in the fields of Criminal Justice and Sociology found in the late 1900s and early 2000s patterns of increased incarceration for American cities, American ethnic centers, as opposed to in more suburban or rural areas of the country. And though more modern 21st century prisons are seeing changes in incarceration rates, disproportionate incarceration for particular places and particular groups of people has remained consistent. This is likely caused by how more economically, ethnically, and opportunity diverse a place, the increased likelihood there is for both unrest and conflict, therefore opening the door for potential adjudication. 

Research on "who" is being incarcerated and "where", as well as "why" they are being incarcerated is an important first step in understanding how American society can work to both continue lessening rates of incarceration and improving the effectiveness of punishment. Incarcerated Americans lose access to civil responsibilities, become estranged from their families and society more broadly, endure mental and physical illness, and often end up back in prison after release. Though incarceration attempts to hinder crime, Americans, especially those of male and minority communities, are being incarcerated consistently and disproportionately. Therefore, some part of the system is broken. However, if researchers can come to understand "who" is being incarcerated and "where" they are coming from, we can begin to comprehend the "why" of prison incarceration, which begins the most pivotal work on "how" we are going to further fix it moving into the future. 

## The Data 

### Description of the Data Source 
This study will use the Incarceration Trends Dataset (2020) from the Vera Institute of Justice as my data source. This source draws together a multitude of studies that analyze incarceration trends in the American prison system between 1983 and 2016. The aforementioned studies are sourced from: the National Corrections Reporting Program (NCRP), the Deaths in Custody Reporting Program (DCRP), the Annual Survey of Jails (ASJ), the Census of Jails (COJ), the Census of State and Federal Adult Correctional Facilities (CAF), the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting Program (UCR), the Centers on Disease Control (CDC) (the National Vital Statistics System Data), the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the U.S. Census Bureau. The studies contain information by American county on several variables, including: county populations, county types, prison populations, as well as general census and prison census data on both gender and racial identity. 

#### Measuring the Independent & Dependent Variables 
As mentioned, the independent and dependent variables in the following study are sourced from census prison records and general population census data collection. The main independent variable of interest in this study, is county type, referred to as "urbanicity" in the coding. County type is rated on a scale of Rural, Small/Midsize, Suburban, or Urban. The co-independent variables of interest will be Gender (Male or Female) and Race (Asian, Black, Latinx, Native American, or White). 

*Note: No or minimal data was available for Non-Binary or Other Race categories within the Incarceration Trends Dataset; so these groups were not included in this study.*

The dependent variable is the incarceration rate, which is calculated as the proportion of incarcerated individuals from an American county (based on their Gender of Race group) per un-incarcerated individuals (between ages 15 to 64) living in that same county (the proportion taken from within the same Gender or Race group). (The age group of 15 to 64 was chosen to depict the proportion of incarceration across both the most common and most eligible prison-age population.)

It is also important to note that all representations in the following study will either be presented as being data from either 2000 or 2016, a 10-year time frame of modern American prisons, presented for comparison.

#### Interpretations of Data Visualizations Pt.1
In 2006, Male prison incarceration rates are significantly higher than Female incarceration rates in all county types. For men, Urban counties saw the highest incarceration rates (1.62%), then Rural counties (1.41%), Small/Midsize counties (1.28%), then with Suburban counties seeing the lowest rates (1.05%). For women, Rural counties saw the highest incarceration rates (0.15%), then Small/Midsize counties (0.12%), Urban counties (0.11%), then with Suburban counties seeing the lowest rates (0.10%).

In 2016, Male prison incarceration rates are also significantly higher than Female incarceration rates in all county types. For men, Rural counties saw the highest incarceration rates (1.42%), then Urban counties (1.27%), Small/Midsize counties (1.26%), then with Suburban counties seeing the lowest rates (1.00%). For women, Rural counties saw the highest incarceration rates (0.18%), then Small/Midsize counties (0.13%), Suburban counties (0.12%), then with Urban counties seeing the lowest rates (0.07%).

Overall, over time and county type, Male incarceration is consistently significantly higher than Female incarceration. In both 2006 to 2016, Male incarceration was consistently higher in Rural and Urban counties over Small/Midsize and Suburban counties. Suburban counties consistently saw the lowest rates of incarceration for men. Female incarceration did not follow the same pattern; female incarceration, generally, declined as the county type became more urban. Rural counties consistently saw the highest rates of incarceration for women. Generally, incarceration rate levels for the men decreased from 2006 to 2016 and increased for women.

#### Interpretations of Data Visualizations Pt.2
In 2006, AAPI incarceration was highest in Rural counties (0.37%), then Small/Midsize counties (0.16%), Suburban counties (0.10%), with Urban counties seeing the lowest rates (0.09%). Black incarceration was highest in Small/Midsize counties (3.37%), then Urban counties (2.75%), Suburban counties (2.28%), with Rural counties seeing the lowest rates (0.55%). Latinx incarceration was highest in Small/Midsize counties (0.81%), then Urban counties (0.72%), Suburban counties (0.51%), with Rural counties seeing the lowest rates (0.32%). Native American incarceration was highest in Small/Midsize counties (1.24%), then Suburban counties (1.02%), Rural counties (0.90%), with Urban counties seeing the lowest rates (0.88%). White incarceration was highest in Small/Midsize counties (0.55%), then Urban counties (0.36%), Suburban counties (0.33%), with Rural counties seeing the lowest rates (0.25%).

In 2016, AAPI incarceration was highest in Rural counties (1.22%), then Small/Midsize counties (0.15%), Urban counties (0.08%), with Suburban counties seeing the lowest rates (0.07%). Black incarceration was highest in Rural counties (3.25%), then Small/Midsize counties (2.34%), Urban counties (2.00%), with Suburban counties seeing the lowest rates (1.56%). Latinx incarceration was highest in Rural counties (0.86%), then Small/Midsize counties (0.72%), Urban counties (0.55%), with Suburban counties seeing the lowest rates (0.42%). Native American incarceration was highest in Rural counties (3.74%), then Small/Midsize counties (1.47%), Suburban counties (0.91%), with Urban counties seeing the lowest rates (0.75%). White incarceration was highest in Rural counties (0.48%), then Small/Midsize counties (0.43%), Urban counties (0.30%), with Suburban counties seeing the lowest rates (0.27%).

For the AAPI community, in both 2006 and 2016, incarceration rates were higher in Rural and Small/Midsize counties than in Suburban or Urban counties. This group also almost always had the lowest incarceration rates than any other group. For Black Americans, in both 2006 and 2016, their incarceration rates were always higher than every other group in Small/Midsize, Suburban and Urban counties. Similarly to the AAPI community, incarceration rates for Black Americans were usually higher in Rural and Small/Midsize counties than in Suburban or Urban counties. For the Latinx community, Small/Midsize counties, always saw higher incarceration rates than did Urban and Suburban counties. For Native Americans, Rural or Small/Midsize counties always saw the highest rates of incarceration and Urban counties saw the lowest rates of incarceration. For White Americans, Suburban and Urban counties saw lower rates of incarceration than Small/Midsize communities in both 2006 and 2016. Generally, most race groups saw similar incarceration rate levels between 2006 and 2016, with Native Americans seeing a drastic increase in 2016. In most cases, Rural or Small/Midsize counties trended to have higher incarceration rates in each racial group than Urban or Suburban counties.

# Creating the `year_2006` and `year_2016` as binary variables to be used in the regression modeling: 
incarceration <- incarceration |>
  mutate(year_2006 = if_else(year == 2006, 1, 0),
         year_2016 = if_else(year == 2016, 1, 0))

#### Interpretations of Multiple Regression Models

## Conclusion 

(i) summarizing results and assessing the extent to which you find support for your hypothesis; you should interpret (in plain English) the main coefficient of interest in your regression. You should also comment on the statistical significance of the estimated coefficient and whether or not you believe the coefficient to represent a causal effect; (ii) describing limitations of the analysis and threats to inference (missing data, confounding, etc), and stating how you could improve your analysis if you had more time/money (improved/better data that would be useful to collect).
