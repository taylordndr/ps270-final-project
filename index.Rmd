## Introduction 

### Research Question 
How has county type, in conjunction with gender and racial composition, impacted prison incarceration rates across American counties from 2006 to 2016?

### Hypothesis 
I hypothesize that the more urban an American county, the higher the prison incarceration rate for Americans living in that county will be; as urban nature increases, prison incarceration rates will increase. And I expect that this trend of higher prison incarceration rate for more urban counties will exist across all genders and races. However, I predict a disproportionately higher rate of prison incarceration for men over women, as well as for Black, Latinx and Native American individuals over White and Asian Americans as the urban nature of American counties increases. Over a 10-year time frame From 2006 to 2016, I predict incarceration rates for all the aforementioned groups to have decreased over time. 

### Importance 
Over the course of American criminal history, Criminal Justice policies have changed drastically and prison incarceration, particularly in the late 20th and early 21st century, saw immense acceleration. However, the most current prison systems are supposedly seeing a decline in incarceration. The following study will work to analyze the "who", "when", and "where", as well as a potential "why" of these modern (2006 to 2016) American incarceration trends. 

Analyzing the extent to which living in an American urban center, across gender and racial lines, enhances the prison incarceration rates in that particular place will face these questions. Much research in the fields of Criminal Justice and Sociology found in the late 1900s and early 2000s patterns of increased incarceration for American cities, American ethnic centers, as opposed to in more suburban or rural areas of the country. And though more modern 21st century prisons are seeing changes in incarceration rates, disproportionate incarceration for particular places and particular groups of people has remained consistent. This is likely caused by how more economically, ethnically, and opportunity diverse a place, the increased likelihood there is for both unrest and conflict, therefore opening the door for potential adjudication. 

Research on "who" is being incarcerated and "where", as well as "why" they are being incarcerated is an important first step in understanding how American society can work to both continue lessening rates of incarceration and improving the effectiveness of punishment. Incarcerated Americans lose access to civil responsibilities, become estranged from their families and society more broadly, endure mental and physical illness, and often end up back in prison after release. Though incarceration attempts to hinder crime, Americans, especially those of male and minority communities, are being incarcerated consistently and disproportionately. Therefore, some part of the system is broken. However, if researchers can come to understand "who" is being incarcerated and "where" they are coming from, we can begin to comprehend the "why" of prison incarceration, which begins the most pivotal work on "how" we are going to further fix it moving into the future. 

## The Data 

### Description of the Data Source 
This study will use the Incarceration Trends Dataset (2020) from the Vera Institute of Justice as my data source. This source draws together a multitude of studies that analyze incarceration trends in the American prison system between 1983 and 2016. The aforementioned studies are sourced from: the National Corrections Reporting Program (NCRP), the Deaths in Custody Reporting Program (DCRP), the Annual Survey of Jails (ASJ), the Census of Jails (COJ), the Census of State and Federal Adult Correctional Facilities (CAF), the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting Program (UCR), the Centers on Disease Control (CDC) (the National Vital Statistics System Data), the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the U.S. Census Bureau. The studies contain information by American county on several variables, including: county populations, county types, prison populations, as well as general census and prison census data on both gender and racial identity. 

#### Measuring the Independent & Dependent Variables 
As mentioned, the independent and dependent variables in the following study are sourced from census prison records and general population census data collection. The main independent variable of interest in this study, is county type, referred to as "urbanicity" in the coding. County type is rated on a scale of Rural, Small/Midsize, Suburban, or Urban. The co-independent variables of interest will be Gender (Male or Female) and Race (Asian, Black, Latinx, Native American, or White). 

*Note: No or minimal data was available for Non-Binary or Other Race categories within the Incarceration Trends Dataset; so these groups were not included in this study.*

The dependent variable is the incarceration rate, which is calculated as the proportion of incarcerated individuals from an American county (based on their Gender of Race group) per un-incarcerated individuals (between ages 15 to 64) living in that same county (based of the same Gender or Race group). (The age group of 15 to 64 was chosen to depict the proportion of incarceration across both the most common and most eligible prison-age population.)

It is also important to note that all representations in the following study will either be presented as being data from either 2000 or 2016, a 10-year time frame of modern American prisons, presented for comparison.

## Conclusion 

(i) summarizing results and assessing the extent to which you find support for your hypothesis; you should interpret (in plain English) the main coefficient of interest in your regression. You should also comment on the statistical significance of the estimated coefficient and whether or not you believe the coefficient to represent a causal effect; (ii) describing limitations of the analysis and threats to inference (missing data, confounding, etc), and stating how you could improve your analysis if you had more time/money (improved data that would be useful to collect).
